### Get your Faceit credentials
To use Faceit signin, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Faceit Developer Portal](https://developers.faceit.com/dashboard/apps).

You will need an active **Faceit account** to access the developer portal and generate these credentials.
You can create an app and create OAuth2 Credentials on the [Faceit Developer Portal](https://developers.faceit.com/dashboard/apps).

  </Step>

<Step>
  ### Set up your environment variables 
  
  Set your Client ID and Client Secret in
  your environment variables. You can use the following variables: 
  
  ```env
  FACEIT_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id' 
  FACEIT_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
  ```
</Step>

  <Step>
  ### Configure the provider

          To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({ 
            socialProviders: {
                faceit: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.FACEIT_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.FACEIT_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
### Sign In with Faceit

to sign in with Faceit, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the Better Auth Client.

- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `faceit`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  /
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
const authClient = createAuthClient();

const signIn = async () => {
  const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "faceit",
  });
};
```
