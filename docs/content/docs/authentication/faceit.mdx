### Get your Faceit credentials
To use Faceit signin, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Faceit Developer Portal](https://developers.faceit.com/dashboard/apps).

You will need an active **Faceit account** to access the developer portal and generate these credentials.
You can create an app and create OAuth2 Credentials on the [Faceit Developer Portal](https://developers.faceit.com/dashboard/apps).

<Callout type="warn">
  When configuring your app in the Faceit Developer Portal, you **MUST** set the **Redirect URL**.
  This cannot be changed later, so make sure to set it correctly.

Faceit requires a HTTPS URL, and does not allow localhost URLs.
You can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local development server.

The Redirect URI may look something like this:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/faceit
```

If you are using ngrok, it may look like this:

```
https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/callback/faceit
```

Make sure to replace `your-domain.com` or `your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app` with your actual domain or ngrok subdomain.
If using a tunnel, you will need to include the tunnel URL in your environment variables and pass it through as the `baseURL` option, as well as adding it in the allowed `trustedOrigins` option.
You can find more information on these configuration items in the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/reference/options)

  ### Set up your environment variables Set your Client ID and Client Secret in
  your environment variables. You can use the following variables:

{/* These are here so that formatting won't break the code block */}

```env
FACEIT_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
FACEIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

</Step>

  <Step>
  ### Configure the provider

          To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                faceit: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.FACEIT_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.FACEIT_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        });
        ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
### Sign In with Faceit

to sign in with Faceit, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the Better Auth Client.

- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `faceit`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const signIn = async () => {
  const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "faceit",
  });
};
```
